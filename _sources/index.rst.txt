**Project Description:**
My web application is called SchoolHub. It consists of a Ninova-like msystem that allows high school students to select a list of pre-determined courses.
In addition, the students can view their grades and cummulative GPA, their attendance and can send their tuition confirmation codes.
All the data regarding attendance and Grades is uploaded by teachers.
There is also a message panel, which is personalized for every course. All in all, this is a scaled-down system that aims to facilitate and enhance the process of recieving grades and other information about one's scholastic performance.
Additionally, the user can complete simple functions like adding and dropping from courses, taking care of finance etc. All is done in a simple and easy to use UI, so that the experience provided is convinient for both the sutdent and the teacher.
